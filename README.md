- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @crazy286
- Iâ€™m interested in becoming a full stack developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react js and javascript
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small project to help improve my skills
- I have a pretty good understanding of html and css

I currently have a few completed website and small apps
I am still working on my javascript skills but I am slowly getting better.
I would appreciate any advice to help me improve...
